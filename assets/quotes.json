  "You make my pupils dilate every time I see you.",
  "Every moment with you is a page in my favorite story.",
  "In every crowd, its your face I search for",
  "I Love you and everything you Love",
  "Flowers fade, but the way she smiled that night stays forever",
  "You gave me premature ventricular contraction",
  "Your smile is my daily dose of sunshine.",
  "You are the peace I crave in this chaotic world",
  "You’re not just special — you’re the reason everything feels special.",
  "In a world full of noise, you are my calm."
